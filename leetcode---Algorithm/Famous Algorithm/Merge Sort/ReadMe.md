# Merge sort Algorithm
This is about famous sorting algorithm, follow the process of data we need to implement the sorting algorithm with faster process so it is a good algorithm for that with time complexity is O(nlogn)

The idea in here we use recursion to seprate array to minimum subarray and base on that we can put the correct index of each subarray to the array need to sort we call is MERGE

The code above is can make you understand more what i am saying in here, take that or you can visit with this link to read and understand more MERGE SORT ALOGORITHM
