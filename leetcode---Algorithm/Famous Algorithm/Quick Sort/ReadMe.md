# Quick sort Algorithm
This is about famous sorting algorithm, follow the process of data we need to implement the sorting algorithm with faster process so it is a good algorithm for that with time complexity is O(nlogn)

The idea inside this that we have to focus TWO things that make quick sort is more effcient with Bubble,select, ...
It is PARTITION and PIVOT

With PIvot we can choose is in array, it can be last index, middle index, first index base on you or test case

The most importance is Partition. It is a function to process the element in range we define, we choose pivot value and through all element in range [low, high] that in argument pass in to Partition. Processing process that all element smaller pivot go to left and greater pivot go to right, after process we take pivot go into correct of that and processing the array in left pivot and right pivot ==> So is it recursion , we will call quicksort in left and righ pivot

The code above is can make you understand more what i am saying in here, take that or you can visit with this link to read and understand more QUICK SORT ALOGORITHM
